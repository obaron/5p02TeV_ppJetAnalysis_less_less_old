FIX THIS!!!
IS the issue in the run_printplots.sh or in the readforests output? It's in the run_printplots input. Let's check the MC, though.
OK, let's take the _Jets_ OUT of the files. HOW DO WE DO THIS? And is the default just leaving it in?? I need to check. **Where are these made in readForests???**

default in Ian's code is:
./printPlots_jetPlots.exe   ${dataCondorDir}/ppData_HighPtJetTrig_ak${R}PFJets_${dateDataIn}_jetPlots_${dataEtaBin}/ ${MCCondorDir}/ppMC_Py8_CUETP8M1_QCDjetAllPtBins_ak${R}PFJets_${dateMCIn}_jetPlots_${MCEtaBin}/   HPtJetTrig_semiOffPy8_${outtag}

This has both _jetPlots_ and PFJets. Next time I have to update everything, I'll change it to this. For now, I will NOT change the readforests output. I will change the jets filename!
I guess. I need to make sure the other scritps aren't looking for this, too.
What a colossal pain in the ass this whole journey has been.
THE QUESTION IS: if I change this for unfolding, will it be messed up for the other scripts? Let's check the input I GUESS. Yup it sure would be.
I found where this is looked for in the bayesUnfoldData and changed it to work on the current files (sans "jets_").
NOTE: it is obviously the renamenhadd that names these files, not the readforests!!

Do I need to rename eta to 2.0 2.0 instead of 0.0 2.0? I think so. (Maybe not, it's 0 to 2 in Ian's code.)

Standardization

Let's look at desired inputs.
Unfolding codes:

1)
run_bayesUnfoldDataSpectra.sh
source run_bayesUnfoldDataSpectra.sh [R=3,4] [dataCondorDir] [data_date] [dataetaBin] [MCCondorDir] [MC_date] [MCetaBin] [etaBinOut] [useSimpleBinning] [BayeskIter]"
eg  source run_bayesUnfoldDataSpectra.sh 3 outputCondor/04.18.19_outputCondor 04-18-19 0eta2 outputCondor/04-22-19_outputCondor 04-22-19 0.0eta2.0 00eta20_testing_05.02 0 5
looking for bayesUnfoldDataSpectra.C
	bayesUnfoldDataSpectra.C:
	
	MC file:   /cms/heavyion/obaron/5p02TeV_ppJetAnalysis/outputCondor/04-22-19_outputCondor/ppMC_Py8_CUETP8M1_QCDjetAllPtBins_ak3PFJets_04-22-19_JERS_0.0eta2.0/Py8_CUETP8M1_QCDjetAllPtBins_ak3PF-allFiles.root
	DATA file: /cms/heavyion/obaron/5p02TeV_ppJetAnalysis/outputCondor/04.18.19_outputCondor/ppData_HighPtJetTrig_ak3PFJets_04-18-19_0eta2/HighPtJetTrig_ak3PF-allFiles.root
	
	
run_bayesUnfoldMCSpectra.sh

	MC file: /cms/heavyion/obaron/5p02TeV_ppJetAnalysis/outputCondor/04-22-19_outputCondor/ppMC_Py8_CUETP8M1_QCDjetAllPtBins_ak3PFJets_04-22-19_JERS_0.0eta2.0/Py8_CUETP8M1_QCDjetAllPtBins_ak3PF-allFiles.root
	IDENTICAL TO DATA UNFOLDING INPUT
	
now let's look at rename'n'hadd.
YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE SCRIPT VARIABLES between JERS and printplots.

Data rename'n'hadd:

	BASE: /cms/heavyion/obaron/5p02TeV_ppJetAnalysis/outputCondor/${date_scratch}_outputCondor
	DIR:  /ppData_HighPtJetTrig_ak${R}PFJets_${date_output}_${desc}
	FILE: HighPtJetTrig_ak${R}PF-allFiles.root

This looks consistent with the data file as currently accepted by input.

MC JERS rename'n'hadd:	
	
	BASE: /cms/heavyion/obaron/5p02TeV_ppJetAnalysis/outputCondor/${date_scratch}_outputCondor
	DIR:  /ppMC_Py8_CUETP8M1_QCDjetAllPtBins_ak${R}PFJets_${date_output}_JERS_${desc}/
	FILE: Py8_CUETP8M1_QCDjetAllPtBins_ak${R}PF-allFiles.root

This also looks consistent, but I bet running will give errors.

2)
printPlots.sh
