FIX THIS!!!
IS the issue in the run_printplots.sh or in the readforests output? It's in the run_printplots input. Let's check the MC, though.
OK, let's take the _Jets_ OUT of the files. HOW DO WE DO THIS? And is the default just leaving it in?? I need to check. **Where are these made in readForests???**

default in Ian's code is:
./printPlots_jetPlots.exe   ${dataCondorDir}/ppData_HighPtJetTrig_ak${R}PFJets_${dateDataIn}_jetPlots_${dataEtaBin}/ ${MCCondorDir}/ppMC_Py8_CUETP8M1_QCDjetAllPtBins_ak${R}PFJets_${dateMCIn}_jetPlots_${MCEtaBin}/   HPtJetTrig_semiOffPy8_${outtag}

This has both _jetPlots_ and PFJets. Next time I have to update everything, I'll change it to this. For now, I will NOT change the readforests output. I will change the jets filename!
I guess. I need to make sure the other scritps aren't looking for this, too.
What a colossal pain in the ass this whole journey has been.
THE QUESTION IS: if I change this for unfolding, will it be messed up for the other scripts? Let's check the input I GUESS. Yup it sure would be.
I found where this is looked for in the bayesUnfoldData and changed it to work on the current files (sans "jets_").
NOTE: it is obviously the renamenhadd that names these files, not the readforests!!

Do I need to rename eta to 2.0 2.0 instead of 0.0 2.0? I think so. (Maybe not, it's 0 to 2 in Ian's code.)

Standardization

Let's look at desired inputs.
Unfolding codes:

1)
run_bayesUnfoldDataSpectra.sh
source run_bayesUnfoldDataSpectra.sh [R=3,4] [dataCondorDir] [data_date] [dataetaBin] [MCCondorDir] [MC_date] [MCetaBin] [etaBinOut] [useSimpleBinning] [BayeskIter]"
eg  source run_bayesUnfoldDataSpectra.sh 3 outputCondor/04.18.19_outputCondor 04-18-19 0eta2 outputCondor/04-22-19_outputCondor 04-22-19 0.0eta2.0 00eta20_testing_05.02 0 5
looking for bayesUnfoldDataSpectra.C
	bayesUnfoldDataSpectra.C:
	
	MC file:   /cms/heavyion/obaron/5p02TeV_ppJetAnalysis/outputCondor/04-22-19_outputCondor/ppMC_Py8_CUETP8M1_QCDjetAllPtBins_ak3PFJets_04-22-19_JERS_0.0eta2.0/Py8_CUETP8M1_QCDjetAllPtBins_ak3PF-allFiles.root
	DATA file: /cms/heavyion/obaron/5p02TeV_ppJetAnalysis/outputCondor/04.18.19_outputCondor/ppData_HighPtJetTrig_ak3PFJets_04-18-19_0eta2/HighPtJetTrig_ak3PF-allFiles.root
	
	
run_bayesUnfoldMCSpectra.sh

	MC file: /cms/heavyion/obaron/5p02TeV_ppJetAnalysis/outputCondor/04-22-19_outputCondor/ppMC_Py8_CUETP8M1_QCDjetAllPtBins_ak3PFJets_04-22-19_JERS_0.0eta2.0/Py8_CUETP8M1_QCDjetAllPtBins_ak3PF-allFiles.root
	IDENTICAL TO DATA UNFOLDING INPUT
	
now let's look at rename'n'hadd.
YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE SCRIPT VARIABLES between JERS and printplots.

Data rename'n'hadd:

	BASE: /cms/heavyion/obaron/5p02TeV_ppJetAnalysis/outputCondor/${date_scratch}_outputCondor
	DIR:  /ppData_HighPtJetTrig_ak${R}PFJets_${date_output}_${desc}
	FILE: HighPtJetTrig_ak${R}PF-allFiles.root

This looks consistent with the data file as currently accepted by input.

MC JERS rename'n'hadd:	
	
	BASE: /cms/heavyion/obaron/5p02TeV_ppJetAnalysis/outputCondor/${date_scratch}_outputCondor
	DIR:  /ppMC_Py8_CUETP8M1_QCDjetAllPtBins_ak${R}PFJets_${date_output}_JERS_${desc}/
	FILE: Py8_CUETP8M1_QCDjetAllPtBins_ak${R}PF-allFiles.root

This also looks consistent, but I bet running will give errors.

output of MC is in /cms/heavyion/obaron/5p02TeV_ppJetAnalysis/outputCondor/06.05.19_outputCondor
now let's do data so we can actually run on this.

note from 06.06.19, I've just added jetPlots into the line in data rename'n'hadd to match the readfiles output. IF THIS IS NOT GOOD, TAKE IT OUT AND CHANGE READFILES.
OK. Everything for unfolding should work up to this point. Now let's try running the unfolding code and pray to God it just works.
NARRATOR: It did not work.

OK, bad news. renamenhadd deletes the data files when it runs. Let's run them again and make a backup, I guess.
Final stance on "jetplots" in the filenames: It is simply not there in Ian's code. I am taking it out of mine. Let's hope this works.
OK, looks like jetplots has been removed from hadded filenames.
IT WORKS!!!

Now let's do jetplots. The tricky part will be getting the files to look different from one another. I will probably need to ass something in the filename.
This will most likely mean more filename fuckery :(
well, let's do a git commit and then fool around.
